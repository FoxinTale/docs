# Starting the A32NX

There are various video tutorials on the [FBW YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCX-dvWU-YQi5U2UjUBtrthg), [320 Sim Pilot's channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/filanjix), or [British Avgeek's channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCiRbrJu4xfX7uRtZpXdFEdg) however some of us are textual learners, or just like to see it in a text form. So here it is.

This is an in depth realistic guide for how to startup the A32NX. If you're looking for a quick, "unrealistic" startup, see the [quickstart guide](quickstart.md). This guide also assumes you are already somewhat familiar with the layout of the A32NX cockpit. If you are not familiar, please see the [Introduction to the A32NX](introbegin.md). Again, this exists as a video form however, text form can be easier to read and remember.

The MCDU setup part assumes you already have a premade flight plan generated from a site like Simbrief or sometthing similar. 
### Preliminary Cockpit Preperation.
- Check both engine master switches are in the off position.
- Check engine mode selector switch is on NORM.
- Check the landing gear lever is indeed down, like a good little lever.
- Turn on both batteries.
- External power on (If available, otherwise start the APU first).
- Wait for the FWC to come online. It is online when three short chirps are heard.
- Perform the APU fire test by holding the test button by its fire handle.
- Start the APU by pushing the master switch on, wait three seconds for the APU inlet flap to open then push the start button.
- Check that the parking brake is on, the flaps are at zero and the speedbrake lever is disarmed and retracted.
- When the APU is available, turn on APU Bleed.
- Extingush any white lights on the overhead panel by turning them to on.

### Cockpit Preperation
- Turn ADIRS to NAV in the order of 1, 3 and then 2.
- Turn No Smoking signs to auto, seatbelt signs to on and set emergency exit lights to auto.
- Turn battery 1 and 2 off then on.
- Perform the fire test on engines 1 and 2 similar to how the APU test was done.
- If on IFR plan, obtain clearance from ATC.
